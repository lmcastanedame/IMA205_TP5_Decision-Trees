# Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains the data, analyses, and findings of a study focused on Alzheimer's disease, leveraging neuroimaging data and clinical information. Our aim is to contribute to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease through computational methods and to support the development of diagnostic tools.

## Contents

- `AlzheimerPaper.pdf`, `AlzheimerPaperClinical.pdf`, `ClinicaPaper.pdf`: These PDFs contain articles, literature reviews, or findings related to Alzheimer's disease, providing background information and context for the project.
- `AtlasAAL2.nii`, `AtlasAICHA.nii`, `AtlasHAMMERS.nii`: Brain atlas files used for neuroimaging data analysis. These files are crucial for understanding the brain regions involved in Alzheimer's disease.
- `dataTP.npz`: A compressed file containing the datasets used in the project. This includes neuroimaging data, clinical data, or any other relevant data compiled for analysis.
- `TP_Trees_CASTANEDA.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the code, analyses, and visualizations performed as part of the study. This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to the methodologies applied and the findings obtained.
