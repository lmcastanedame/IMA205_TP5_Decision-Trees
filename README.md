# Alzheimer Prediction Using Gray Matter Density from T1w MRI 

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive analysis aimed at predicting Alzheimer's disease by examining the gray matter density in T1-weighted MRI scans. It encompasses data preprocessing, analysis, model training, and validation steps, providing insights into the potential of neuroimaging data in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

## Prerequisites

This project requires several Python libraries, including but not limited to:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- nibabel

The exact list of required libraries and their installation commands are provided at the beginning of the notebook.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:
- **Introduction**: A brief overview of the objectives and the approach.
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Steps to load, clean, and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Analysis**: Detailed analysis of gray matter density and its implications in Alzheimer's prediction.
- **Model Training and Validation**: Building and evaluating the predictive model.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential future directions.
